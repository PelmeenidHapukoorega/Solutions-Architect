# Module: Azure storage services
# Key notes

To actually design anything in Azure you gotta understand the compute and networking stack like its your own toolbox. VMs, functions, containers, VNets, subnets, routing they all snap together like a puzzle that decides how fast, secure and reliable your whole setup runs.

**Bottom line:**
Build smart now, because Future You aint trying to debug a busted network at 2 AM wondering why a VM cant talk to anything.
