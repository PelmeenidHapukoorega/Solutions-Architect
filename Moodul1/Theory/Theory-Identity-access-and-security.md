# Module: Azure identity, access and security
# Key notes

If you wanna actually secure anything in Azure you gotta treat identity like the front door to your whole kingdom. Entra ID, RBAC, Conditional Access, Zero Trust thats the real backbone. Permissions, policies, sign ins, verifications they all lock together like a vault puzzle deciding who gets in, what they touch, and how bad things go if you slip up.

**Bottom line:**
Lock your house now, because Future You aint tryna explain to your boss why some rogue service principal just joy rode through your subscription like it GTA free roam mode.
