## My Journey to become Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect

## The start of it all November 15.11

Me doing my best to master Azure and eventually become Solutions architect.

I figured id make a short description of why this profile and repo exist in the first place. I used to study IT years ago but never grasped the concepts at the time but always wanted to work in IT since its always been my passion. After finishing trades school I wounded up working in sales. Over the years ive continued to work in sales but in various companys and in various roles.

However it was never smt that i wanted to do, all my life ive been searching for this 1 thing as im guessing a lot of people look for throught their lives, some may not even ever find it. 
I was lucky, and i did the unthinkable. In 2025 August i decided i had enough. I had worked in sales for 6 years total (well technically) and it had made me extremely unhappy. 
So i decided to quit my job without knowing what exactly it is that im going to do, i had no idea where to start, i had to move from the city i had lived in for 7 years, back to my parents house. Literal ground 0. For weeks i was stressed, unmotivated, with no idea what to do.

However Im not the type of person who gives up. Ever. 

So I remembered what a close friend of mine told me at the start of the year when i told him that i wanted to quit sales entirely and move back to IT. He said instinctively "Cloud" (Shout out to you Arthur if you are reading this. +rep). 
After talking about it for a few moments, i went home, looked it up and got started with AWS on coursera (which i have fundamental certs of). I knew of Azure but i was thinking at the time (July) that i should stick to 1 and learn it entirely and specialize in it. It was an impulsive descision but i just kept telling myself "dude just start". 

And i did. 

Anyway after being in the process of the move back I decided to give it a go with Azure since AWS didnt click for me, 
it was confusing, the courses were mostly videos of talking complex concepts (for me at least) and it was hard for me to do labs properly because i lacked funds for it. 

Now with Azure, everything clicked for me instantly, the learning is super fun, easy to follow. The labs are also fun, when i run into an error i get hyped a bit lol, its fun to google what it means and just track the entire process of how i solved it. Each lab ive completed thus far gives me an immense satisfaction and insane level of dopamine. Each time. So far ive been learning this for 3 months and ive yet to get bored. Im excited to see what im able to do in the future.

The whole point of this monologue is: This repo, this profile and everything in it, is a promise to myself that I can if I really want to.

I sincerely hope that some of the readers may find a bit of hope in all this. Just when you think that nothing is gonna work out, it does. And it didnt happen because i was sulking and cursing the world, it was the opposite. Never lose hope, never give up and most importantly... 

Just start doing.

## December update 07.12

I admit, i got too greedy at first by starting 305 learn path as the first thing, but it was a good lesson in humility and i had to remind myself that rushing stuff doesnt get me far. Getting into 305 was fun until i reached concepts which i struggled to understand, so instead of pushing myself to the finish i decided to F that basically and get this thing right. So i started as everyone does with Azure which is back to basics. Currently ive been focusing on studying the materials for AZ 900 which if you have browsed this repo would know. 

In any case, i was struggling with actually finding a method that would make me understand the concepts i am learning. I dont learn by watching videos where people talk, i dont learn just by reading. So i adopted the WHY, WHAT, HOW method and wow is it a game changer. Now my study approach is using that, for example if i take a topic i use that same method about everything the modules cover. Yep even simple terminology like virtual machines. Every. Single. One. Additionally to that i hold myself to a standard when it comes to explanations, so in AZ 900 folders i decided to explain everything in my own words as to how I interpret it instead of using AI, granted AI is a great tool for making bulletpoints, but there isnt much use of those bulletpoints if i myself dont fully understand what does what, why it does so and how exactly.

This way of studying is slow, tiring, tedious but if anything it has taught me more discipline and genuine understanding of the concepts that im learning. If i hit a wall or dont understand say wording, or dont fully grasp the concept of what something is or how exactly it works, i google or use AI to help explain it to me in simple terms which i in return verify by testing it in Azure asking on Azure subreddit or the simple way of googling.

So to put it shortly, this months focus has been going back to fundamentals to really get this right and reorganize and create a structure to follow for all my future learnings. 

My goal still remains the same, and i dont see this as setback, if anything this has been a great learning point and i will continue to push on. Next update will be after I pass AZ 900 which im sure i will do now that i have genuine foundation without the hype.
