## Journey to become Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect

Me doing my best to master Azure and eventually become Solutions architect.

I figured id make a short description of why this profile and repo exist in the first place. I used to study IT years ago but never grasped the concepts at the time but always wanted to work in IT since its always been my passion. After finishing trades school I wounded up working in sales. Over the years ive continued to work in sales but in various companys and in various roles.

However it was never smt that i wanted to do, all my life ive been searching for this 1 thing as im guessing a lot of people look for throught their lives, some may not even ever find it. 
I was lucky, and i did the unthinkable. In 2025 August i decided i had enough. I had worked in sales for 6 years total (well technically) and it had made me extremely unhappy. 
So i decided to quit my job without knowing what exactly it is that im going to do, i had no idea where to start, i had to move from Tallinn back to my parents house. Literal ground 0. For weeks i was stressed, unmotivated, with no idea what to do.

However Im not the type of person who gives up. Ever. 

So I remembered what a close friend of mine told me at the start of the year when i told him that i wanted to quit sales entirely and move back to IT. He said instinctively "Cloud" (Shout out to you Arthur if you are reading this. +rep). 
After talking about it for few moments, i went home, looked it up and got started with AWS on coursera (which i have useless certs of). I knew of Azure but i was thinking at the time (July) that i should stick to 1 and learn it entirely and specialize it. It was an impulsive descision but i just kept telling myself "dude just start". 

And i did. 

Anyway after being in the process of the move back I decided to give it a go with Azure since AWS didnt click for me, 
it was confusing, the courses were mostly videos of talking complex concepts (for me at least) and it was hard for me to do labs properly because i lacked funds for it. 

Now with Azure, everything clicked for me instantly, the learning is super fun, easy to follow. The labs are also fun, when i run into an error i get hyped a bit lol, its fun to google what it means and just track the entire process of how i solved it. Each lab ive completed thus far gives me an immense satisfaction and insane level of dopamine. Each time. So far ive been learning this for 3 months and ive yet to get bored. Im excited to see what im able to do in the future.

The whole point of this monologue is: This repo, this profile and everything in it, is a promise to myself that I can if I really want to.

I sincerely hope that some of the readers may find a bit of hope in all this. Just when you think that nothing is gonna work out, it does. And it didnt happen because i was sulking and cursing the world, it was the opposite. Never lose hope, never give up and most importantly... just start doing.

**Important!** In order for transparency and defeating imposter syndrome: Some explanations in my Theory and Lab notes were refined using AI tools, however every lab, command and troubleshooting step was performed and verified by me.

## Additional Documentation
### Ive listed below my notes from theory side of the labs and made it more convenient for myself to learn and added quick notes to myself to better memorize what I learned. You will also find quick links to labs themselves.
