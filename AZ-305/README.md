# My Journey through AZ-305
From labs and theory to eventually getting the certification. Here I have documented everything I have done so far towards AZ-305 certification. You can find both labs and theory. Theory has been revamped to be more concise without unnecessary information that hogs the brain, so I have structured my notes accordingly for ease of memory and study in preperation for my exam.

## Additional Documentation
### Ive listed below my notes from theory side of the labs and made it more convenient for myself to learn and added quick notes to myself to better memorize what I learned. You will also find quick links to labs themselves.

**Important!** In order for transparency and defeating imposter syndrome: Some explanations in my Theory and Lab notes were refined using AI tools, however every lab, command and troubleshooting step was performed and verified by me.
