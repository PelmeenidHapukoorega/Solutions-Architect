**Important!** In order for transparency and defeating imposter syndrome: Some explanations in my Theory and Lab notes were refined using AI tools, however every lab, command and troubleshooting step was performed and verified by me.

## Additional Documentation
### Ive listed below my notes from theory side of the labs and made it more convenient for myself to learn and added quick notes to myself to better memorize what I learned. You will also find quick links to labs themselves.
