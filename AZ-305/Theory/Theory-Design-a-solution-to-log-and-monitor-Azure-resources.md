In on-premises days, you could walk into the server room and see the blinking orange light. In Azure, **logs are your only eyes and ears**.

If you treat logging as an afterthought or a "debug tool" for developers, you are flying blind. You need **Observability**. You need to know that the database is slowing down *before* it crashes, and you need to know a hacker is brute-forcing your admin account *before* they get in. Without this, you are purely reactive, running around putting out fires while your customers tweet about your downtime.

**Bottom line:**
If your users have to call you to tell you the application is down, you have already failed. Design your monitoring so you know about the problem (and the solution) before the phone even rings.
