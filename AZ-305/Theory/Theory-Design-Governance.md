Governance might sound like boring corporate paperwork, but in Azure, it’s the only thing standing between you and a chaotic, overpriced dumpster fire. You can’t just spin up resources at random and hope for the best. You need a hierarchy—Management Groups, Subscriptions, Resource Groups—that dictates exactly who can do what, who pays the bill, and who gets locked out.

Think of it as the laws of physics for your cloud environment. Without a solid governance design, you aren’t building an enterprise architecture; you’re building a digital Wild West where security is a suggestion, organization is a myth, and your budget exists only to be broken.

**Bottom line:**
Design your hierarchy right from day one, or get ready to explain to your boss why "Dev-Test-VM-01" just ate the entire IT budget for the quarter because nobody put a limit on it.
