Identity is the **new firewall**. In the old days, you could just hide everything behind a network perimeter and feel safe. In the cloud, that perimeter is gone. Your users are connecting from coffee shops, the API is public, and your data is everywhere.

Designing for identity means accepting a harsh reality: **Hackers don't break in anymore; they log in.**

If you treat Identity like a simple phonebook instead of a security layer, you are finished. You need to verify *who* someone is (Authentication) and strictly control *what* they can touch (Authorization). Without this, your fancy encryption and network rules are just expensive decorations on a house with the front door left wide open.

**Bottom line:**
Secure the identity first. If you don't, you aren't an Architect; you're just setting the table for an attacker to come in, sit down, and eat your lunch using valid credentials.
