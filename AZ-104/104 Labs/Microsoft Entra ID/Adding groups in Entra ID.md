# Lab 2: Adding groups in Entra ID

1. Navigated to `Groups` in Entra ID, created new group and selected `Microsoft 365` as type instead of security group this time.
2. Added `Admin` user i had created prior as the owner and 2 subsequent users as the members for the group.

Verified that group now shows up in the list and is named as described:

### Summary

Nothing to add really other than switching types between security and just regular groups is simple and quick. It all shows up in the same panel and is easily distinguishable by types.
