# Lab 9b: Implementing Container instances

### Goal:

To learn how to implement and deploy Azure container instances

**Job Skills**

* Deploying container instances using docker images.
* Testing and verifying deployment of container instances.

## Part 1: Deplying container instance using docker image

### Goal:

Create simple web app using docker image.

1. In the portal went to `container instances` > `+ create` and created new one.
2. In the `basics` gave it the following values:

* Added resource group `az104-rg9`
* Named it `az104-c1`
* Region > norway east
* Image source > default: quickstart images
* Image > default `mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld:latest (Linux)`

3. In the `networking` added dns name `webappdns`. This meant the container would be available at `webappdns-label.region.azurecontainer.io`
4. In the `monitoring` unchecked `enable container instance logs`
5. Left the rest default and went to creation:

## Part 2: Testing and verifying deployment of container instance

1. Once deployment was finished went to the resource.
2. From the overview page verified that `status` was running:

Next i copied the url under `FQDN` > `webappdns.d8hsabdmg7akhkg6.norwayeast.azurecontainer.io` and pasted it to other browser tab:

This meant the container instance was indeed running.

3. Went back to `settings` > `containers` > `logs`:

The log entries represented HTTP GET request generated by displaying the application in the other browser.

Performed cleanup
