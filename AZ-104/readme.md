# AZ 104 Study approach

For the past few days i had struggled to understand how exactly should I approach AZ 104.

I wanted to approach it the same way I did with AZ 900 and i quickly understood i cant do it the same way because i realised the following:

* AZ 900 teaches you definitions and concepts overall
* AZ 104 is all about experience and practical assessments
* AZ 305 combines both and teaches you how to come up with solutions that work best for your needs and customer needs.

So knowing that, AZ 104 folder will have all kinds of different labs and necessary things that are relevant to document will be documented inside the lab notes.
