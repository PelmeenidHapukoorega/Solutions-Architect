# Notes about Vnets

* AZ VNet is a logical isolation of cloud resources
* VNets can be used to provision and manage VPNs in Azure
* Each VNet has its own classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block and can be linked to other VNets and on premises networks.
* VNets can be linked with an on-premises IT infrastructure to create hybrid or cross-premises solutions, when the CIDR blocks of the connecting networks dont overlap.
