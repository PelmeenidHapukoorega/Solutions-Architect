# Lab 01: Cloud Shell Mechanics and Lifecycle

## The Goal

To validate the "Cloud Shell Runbook" theory by getting hands-on with the underlying mechanics. Proving exactly where data is stored, how to recover it when the shell "crashes," and how to set up the environment for future AZ-104 labs.

## Objectives

**Test Persistence:** Proving the difference between the temporary Home Drive (`$HOME`) and the permanent File Share (`clouddrive`).

**Mastering the Tools:** Using the built in Monaco Editor and az interactive mode.

**Git Workflow:** cloning the official Microsoft Lab files (essential for the rest of the course).

**Disaster Recovery:** Intentionally unmounting (break) the storage and successfully reconnecting it without losing data.
