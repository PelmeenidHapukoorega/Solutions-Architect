## Automation of Cloud Shell

DevOps side of training

Rules to follow:

1. Snippet logic: No pasting 500 lines of JSON, explain in parameters and variables.
2. The "DependsOn" Property: Note how automation handles the order of operations "Example: VM depends on NIC, NIC depends on VNet, etc etc"
3. Bicep vs JSON: Include Bicep version; much easier to read than ARM JSON.
