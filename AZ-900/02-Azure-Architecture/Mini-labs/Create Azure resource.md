### Summary

Creating a VM through the API is pretty straight forward and easy, nothing too complex. Learned how to provision VM, and how fairly easy and logical it is to navigate in the API. 

For more in depth provisioning of VM see: [VM and Nginx Install Lab](../../../AZ-305/Virtual%20machines/lab-notes/VM%20and%20Nginx%20%20install.md)
