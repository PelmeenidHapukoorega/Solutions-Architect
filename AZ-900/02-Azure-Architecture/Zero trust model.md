## My interprentations

## Zero trust model

Zero Trust is a security model that assumes the worst case scenario and protects resources with that expectation. Zero Trust assumes breach at the outset, and then verifies each request as though it originated from an unctrolled network.

### Why does it exist?

It exists because the traditional security model failed to protect organizations in the face of 2 major shifts: the rise of cloud computing and the increase in sophisticated cyber threats. It was created to address the critical outdated assumption of the previous security model which was trust everything inside the network.

### What does it do?

It directs all security efforts continously verify, strictly limit, and actively monitor every single interaction within the environment.

### How does it work?

It works by enforcing its 3 core principles: Verify explicitly, use least privilega, assume breach. In essence it replaces 1 time, implicit trust with continous, dynamic verification across the entire digital estate.

## Adjusting to Zero trust

Zero trust works in essence that instead of assuming that a device is safe because its within the corporate network, it requires everyone to authenticate regardless. Then it grans access based on authentication rather than location.

### Summary

Zero trust model is a good security method for authenticating users, it means that it doesnt matter where the user or device is being logged in or from what network/resource, you will need to authenticate regardless. Zero trust literally means it doesnt trust anything and there for needs your authentication before it gives you access. It demands continous verification of every access attempt.
