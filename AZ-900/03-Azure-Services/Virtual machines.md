## Virtual machines

VMs, or virtual machines provide IaaS in the form of a virtualized server and can be use ind multitude of ways. Just like a physical computer, you can customize all of the software running on your VM. Ideal choice when you need total control over OS, ability to run custom software, use custom hosting configurations.

### Why does it exist?

VMs are fundamental flexibile units of computing power, that allow cloud providers to share massive physical resources among thousands of customers efficiently and cost effectively.

### What does it do?

They act as isolated and on demand computer systems that run your software seperate from the physical hardware they share.

### How does it work?

VMs work through a process called virtualization which is the process of using specialized software called "hypervisor" to carve up a single, powerful physical server into multiple isolated and independent virtual computer systems.

### Summary

Virtual machines are fundamental building blocks for building raw infrastructure. Think of a virtual machine like a computer that you download and manage software on.

## Scale VMs in Azure

You can either run single VMs for testing, minor task or development tasks, or you can group them together to provide high availability, scalability and redundancy. In Azure you can also manage the grouping of VMs with features such as scale sets and availability sets.

## Availability sets

Virtual machine availability sets are a tool to help you build a more resilient and highly available environment. They are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have a varied power, network connectivity preventing you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power failure.
