## My interpretations

Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person, service or a device.

### Why does it exist?

Because its the fundamental gatekeeper of security and access in both digital and physical workloads.

### What does it do?

Authentication peforms 1 primary and critical function: verifying a claimed identity. In other words it veryfies that whoever wants to have access needs to be approved in the first place.

### How does it work?

It works by having the system compare the "proof" you provide against the security identity records it has stored.

### Summary

Authentication makes sure that only registered users allowed to access apss or data can do so. Its a protection layer.
