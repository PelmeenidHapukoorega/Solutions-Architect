## My interpretations

## Azure migrate

### Why does it exist?

To solve complex challenges when it comes to moving existing workloads (servers, applications, databases and virtual desktops)
from on prem to cloud environment.

### What does it do?

It acts as a single console to help an organization discover, assess and migrate its existing workloads to Azure.

### How does it work?

It works as a structured 3 phase process to move your on prem to Azure cloud with minimal risk and optimized costs.
You start by deploying appliance onto physical server, the appliance then performs agentless scan to collect configuration 
metadata, then Azure analyses collected data to perform assessment. In phase 2 you set up replication, the tool then performs initial
full replication of your source servers disks and data to Azure storage. Afterwards you need to run a non disruptive test migration,
it creates a fully functional copy of your server in Azure but keeps on prem running, this validates that app works correctly before
finalizing the move. Phase 3, after successful testing you execute the final planned cutover, post migration you should continously
monitor the migrated workloads to ensure performance meets benchmarks and to look for further cost reduction opportunities.

### Summary

Azure migrate is for organizations wanting to migrate their infra to cloud with minimal costs and risks. I.e its a low risk path to 
the world of cloud.
