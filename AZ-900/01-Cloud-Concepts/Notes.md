# Describe Cloud concepts

In order to design anything you have to understand how regions, subscriptions, and resources all fit together like a 25-piece puzzle. This foundation determines how stable, secure, and scalable your solutions will end up.

> **Bottom line:** Architect brain now so future you doesn't have to clean up technical debt later.

## What is cloud computing?

* Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services (like virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking) over the internet.
* Cloud services also include advanced technology offerings such as Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).
* Because it uses the internet, it is not constrained by physical infrastructure like a traditional datacenter.
* This flexibility allows you to rapidly expand your IT infrastructure without waiting to build new physical facilities.


## My interpretation

### WHY does this exist?
* What pain points did the businesses have?
* What limitations existed before?
* What is the purpose behind its creation?

Cloud computing was made with business in mind in a sense that before you had to have your own physical infra, workforce,
spending a lot of money for equipment that would handle storage, data etc. Cloud tackled that problem by letting users do all of that in the cloud,
with only spending money on resources that you as the user actually use. Before cloud the main limitations was needing a lot of money to build datacentres, 
hire additional personal to manage each sector of different computing aspects, cloud lets you do it all in one place.


### WHAT does it do?
* What is its job?
* What role does it play?
* What solution does it provide?

Cloud computings job is to do everthing that is usually done by having physical infra,
but over the internet and in a more simplified and efficient way. You dont need to set up physical server, then additionally
install VM on it, the configure network for it seperately. It lets you do all that in a whim and almost instantly in one platform.
You dont need to buy seperate equipment for say storage, or seperate equipment for handling network. 
It lets you do everything in one place and thats the magic.

### HOW does it work? 
* How does the service behave?
* The steps or flow
* What happens behind the scenes?

The service works over the internet, for example you log into the portal, you create a resource like VM, 
you set the configs, the rules you need and then it spins it up. 
In the background that information goes to clouds own datacentre over the internet and creates what you set up.

### Summary

Bsically Cloud computing is as having physical infra and all the workers but instead on the internet and without the workers.
It helps businesses keep everything in 1 place without the need for various equipment, its cost efficient and easier to manager than phsysical infra.
